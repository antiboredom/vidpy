VidPy
=================================

A Python video editor and compositor based on the `MLT Multimedia
Framework <https://www.mltframework.org/>`_.

Note: VidPy is currently in alpha - there are probably a bunch of bugs, and
the api will likely change. If youâ€™re interested in testing it out,
please do, and leave comments/suggestions/issues in the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/antiboredom/vidpy/issues>`_.
